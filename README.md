-While using the old scrip, pressing the button took firstly 3.0 seconds to later 0.6 second to compute, the new script only took roughly about 0.27 seconds to compute the analyze table, which is much more efficient.

## Summary


-The Advantage of refactoring codes is that it takes a shorter time to run the code with larger amount of data; while the script are also much more easier to understand the obvious function. The disadvantage is that it is very hard and time consuming to develope.


-The volumes were set to a long array instead of just seting up as a defaul variable with the old script totalVOlumes=0; and volumes were set to be increased with the current ticket. In terms of formatting, the for loop in refactored VBA script also gave more perciseness and automatively show the positive tickers, compare to the original that needs to manually color the cells after obtained outcome.
